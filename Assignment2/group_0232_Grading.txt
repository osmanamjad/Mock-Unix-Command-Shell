Total deductions: -6
Grade: C+, F for Salat B
Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:
    http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/newstudents/transition/academic/grading
The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:
     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog.
==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]
Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:
- [ ]  No evidence of Product or Sprint backlog -6
- [ ]  No evidence of team assigning tasks to team members -3
- [ ]  SB items not taken directly from PB -1
- [ ]  SB items not broken down into smaller steps -1
- [ ]  PB, SB uses noticeably bad grammar and/or spelling -2
[Total deductions in this section: 0]

==== Java Style ==== [up to -6]
Steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:
- [ ]  Java naming conventions not followed (camelCase, no_underscores) -1
- [ ]  Instance variable names not meaningful (e.g., "Label1" is not a good name) -1
- [ ]  Bad indentation -1
- [ ]  Lack of consistency in style across files -1
- [ ]  Bad use of whitespace: too much or too little -1

==== Design ==== [up to -6]
Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:
- [X]  public instance variables instead of setters and getters -1 to -2
- [ ]  not a good breakdown of classes and methods (everything static;) -1
- [ ]  long methods exist (more than roughly 30 lines from brace to brace) -1
- [ ]  hard to add new commands -1
- [ ]  no unified path handling mechanism -2
- [X]  redirection doesn't easily incorporate new commands -2
TA COMMENTS: Avoid using protected, use private instead, redirection locked into echo, inputHistory should not be a public static variable (breaks 
encapsulation), have seperate input / output classes, avoid printing during command execution, Validator has almost all public instance vars
[Total deductions in this section: 3]

==== Javadoc ==== [up to -3]
Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:
- [ ]  Missing Javadoc on methods -1 for infrequent problems, up to -3 for frequent
- [ ]  Missing Javadoc on class -1
- [ ]  No Javadoc on instance vars -1
- [ ]  Missing use @param and @return tags -1
- [ ]  Unclear English: bad grammar, bad spelling up to -2
TA COMMENTS: None of the classes in commands and container has class Javadoc.
