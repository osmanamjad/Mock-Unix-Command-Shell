What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished the implementation for mv and get command
    - Commented the code in the mv and get classes

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Create unit tests for some of the commands (cd, echo, mv)
    - Create an implementation for load command

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Nothing
