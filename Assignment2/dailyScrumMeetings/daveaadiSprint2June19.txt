What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Completed a majority of the IO Class
    - Worked on the JShell class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Finish implementing the LS Commands

Am I blocked on anything?
	- LS Class required other features to be implemented, awaiting those features to be
	  implemented.
