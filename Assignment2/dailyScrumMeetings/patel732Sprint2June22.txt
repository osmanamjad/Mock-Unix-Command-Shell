What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished coding the CommandMaster class
    - Let Aaditya work on the PathFinder class, and instead worked on
      the Jshell

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Finalize the Jshell
    - Finish the Echo command

Am I blocked on anything?

    - Still need to finish on the CD command
