# Mock-Unix-Command-Shell
Made in a group of 4, this program attempts to mock the Unix command shell by combining software design patterns (such as Iterator, Singleton, and Builder) and complex code to create a program that acts as a file management system whilst also providing functionality for nearly 20 Unix commands.

The purpose of this project was to learn to work in a group and divide tasks in a way so that everyone can contribute. Further, we honed our
skills in developing in Java, specifically using object-oriented programming. 

To be able to execute this project, you only have to clone/download the "src" folder, and from there the driver folder will contain the file
that needs to be executed/ran in order for the program to work.
